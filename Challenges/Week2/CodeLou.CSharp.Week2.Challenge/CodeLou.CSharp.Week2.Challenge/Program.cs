            // to the top of this file to import the System namespace so that the C# compiler knows where
            // to look for the Console class.

            // Task 2:
            // This application won't build because of a syntax error. Fix the code below to make it build.
            // Hint: In Visual Studio, you can build the project by selecting "Build Solution" from the
            //       build menu, or by pressing <Ctrl>+<Shift>+B.

            // Task 3:
            // Capture the number of seconds that the user would like to count down before liftoff.
            // Hint: You should use another method of the Console class and store the output into a
            //       variable to use later.


            // Task 4:
            // Write a condition to test whether the number that they entered is less than or equal to zero.
            // Call the IsLessThanOrEqualToZero() method below, passing the user's number as a parameter.
            // If the result is true, write "Please enter a positive number." to the console.
            // Hint: The input that you captured is currently a string type. You will have to "parse" it
            //       as a different type in order to pass it to the IsLessThanOrEqualToZero function.


            // Task 5:
            // Add an "else" block to the condition from Task 4. This should be run in the case that the
            // number is greater than zero. Write each number to the console, counting backwards, from the 
            // user's number to zero. Then write, "LIFTOFF!".
            // Hint: You can accomplish this with one of several kinds of loops, including "while" and
            //       "for". You can choose whichever you'd like to solve the task. The Microsoft
            //       Developer Network (MSDN) website contains all of the documentation for C#. If you want
            //       to learn more about loops, visit https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/32dbftby.aspx.
